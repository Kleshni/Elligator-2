C implementation of the [Elligator 2](http://elligator.cr.yp.to/elligator-20130828.pdf) algorithm for the [Curve25519](https://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html) elliptic curve. The library also provides a function for point conversion from Ed25519 to Curve25519.

The `u` value and the square root function are taken from the section 5.5 of the Elligator specification.
